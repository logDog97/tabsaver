# TabSaver
**A beautiful, nifty utility to keep tab-management at ease, while also saving you boat-loads of memory when you need it most!**

Tab Saver is a quick, nifty and beautiful session manager that manages all your tabs with a friendly, straightforward UI and doesn't get in your way. It lists all your open tabs and allows you to select the tabs to save, and provides options for both quick save as well as saving the current state as a session, which can be loaded on will. It utilizes chrome.storage.sync functionality to save your tabs to the cloud, which can be seamlessly loaded again, in case you ever lose your sessions. 

## But why use it?

*You can manually optimize memory usage by saving your tabs and clearing them from memory
*Chrome sync support 
*Easy-to-use, easy on the eye UI
*Because you're awesome!

*PS: This extension is here, because I don't really want to pay the $5 Google asks to developers. Because there might not be such a thing as free lunch, but there sure are free extensions!*
